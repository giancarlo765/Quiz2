                My name is Giancarlo Dominic P Clamor I’m 21 years old and a college student, my hobbies are playing video games, playing guitar, and also modding games. What I do in my spare time is spending my time inside my home and playing games, and also trying to communicate in discord which is a new thing to me, it became my day-to-day thing if I had to spare some time since it’s COVID so we got to stay at home as much as possible.

                Me as a person you can take me as a ongoing, go with the flow friendly guy. But I respect who show also some respect it’s sounds obvious because it’s how I am how I was born to it. Anyways if you need help of something, I would willingly help you because this is how I interact with people around me. And also, I can help you play with games together I hope I’ll be a good teammate or friend to you. And you can share your problems let me know I will listen to you.

                This is how I am and will try to change my attitude if needed be, I can be a serious person from time to time and try to hide my true attitude to the person. This how I will be.

                My goal for this journey when I'm at 30 is making investments, pay bills, or spend my earnings well. Thus every adults do I may not dream big but I set my goals straight for me and my future family. This things may seems natural or simple but I'm content or maybe, just maybe there might something if only God knows it's already been planned.
